# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis
In our dataset it was found that the collected data from the 9th graders at Thomas High School was insufficient and skewing the dataset. The goal was to remove this incomplete data and perform the same analysis that was completed in module 4. The main concerns of our analysis include: average math and reading scores, passing percentage, total budget and school spending per student, and overall passing percentage. 

## Results
In comparison to the original analysis from the module, the results generally remained the same. Although an entire subset of students was removed from our dataset, overall the amount of data was so large that it made little difference to the analysed results. 

### Side-by-side Comparison

As is evident in the above side-by-side comparison, removing the 9th grade data from Thomas High School had minimal effect on the overall outcome as the results remained within a reasonable range.

## Summary
Overall the most significant changes in our data set was the number of students counted at Thomas High School. This had a direct effect on all measurable outcomes at that school specifically. However, when combined with the data from all other schools in the dataset, the overall change in passing percentages in reading and math was minimal.
